# _Consciousness explore_


**Explorations of the concept of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness), [self-awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness), and  consciousness in [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_correlates_of_consciousness) and [machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness)**

 
_Initiated: February 1, 2022_ (Last updated: 20220321)

**Naive credo**: (i) Make phenomena (e.g. `consciousness'), processes and values a conscious experience ("bevisstgj√∏re prosesser");<br> (ii) Representation learning, attention and relationships. [Inspired by [Gallileo's Error](https://www.philipgoffphilosophy.com/books.html), [The Conscious Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08568), and ... [Could Machines Have It?](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan8871)]
