# _Consciousness explore_


**Explorations of the concept of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness), [self-awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness), and  consciousness in [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_correlates_of_consciousness) and [machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness)**

 
_Initiated: February 1, 2022_ (Last updated: 2023-02-09)

**Credo**: (i) Make phenomena, processes and values a conscious experience ("bevisstgjøre prosesser");<br> (ii) Representation learning, attention, and relationships. [Inspired by [Gallileo's Error](https://www.philipgoffphilosophy.com/books.html), [The Conscious Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08568), and ...
