### Hemodynamic state equations

The remaining state variables of each region are biophysical states engendering the BOLD signal and mediate the
translation of neuronal activity into hemodynamic responses. Hemodynamic states are a function of, and only of,
the neuronal state of each region. These equations have been described elsewhere (Friston et al., 2000) and constitute a
hemodynamic model that embeds the _Balloon–Windkessel model_ (Buxton et al., 1998; Mandeville et al., 1999).
